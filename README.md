# Cache_Memory_Controller_FFT_Algo
Design of 32-bit Cache Memory Controller: (12/2016)
Development of a C-code for a 32-bit cache memory controller 
and analyzed which architecture would be best for the it.

FFT algorithm was annalysed using this controller and the data was
used to annalyse which stratergy( write back, write through allocate, 
write through non allocate with different combinations will be the best).

This was done by Apaar Mishra under the guidance of Dr. Jason Losh for the course EE 6313 in University of Texas at Arlington.
